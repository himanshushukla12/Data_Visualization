# Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS) and Bubble Plot Assignment

## Goal

The goal of this assignment is two-fold:

1. Application of MDS (Multi-Dimensional Scaling) for dimension reduction.
2. Create a 4D visualization using a Bubble plot.

## Details

MDS method utilizes a distance (dissimilarity) matrix to create a low-dimensional representation of high-dimensional data. The assignment involves using the distance between different Indian cities to compute a 2D representation and visualize it using a scatterplot.

- The MDS method does not consider N-S, E-W direction knowledge, so the orientation must be inferred from the final plot.

## Data Preparation

1. **Read Latitude-Longitude Data:**
   - Read latitude-longitude data of approximately 150 Indian cities from a database. The CSV data may be accessed directly from [this site](https://simplemaps.com/data/in-cities) using the URL "https://simplemaps.com/static/data/country-cities/in/in.csv".

2. **Compute Distance Matrix:**
   - Compute the distance matrix (distance between every pair of cities) using the `distance.distance` method from the Python package `geopy`. Example use:
     ```python
     from geopy import distance

     # Example for computing distance between two locations
     D = distance.distance(latlon1, latlon2).km
     ```

3. **Create Zone Column:**
   - Create a 'zone' column in the data frame for each city based on its `admin_name`. Use the provided mapping to assign zones.

## MDS and Dimension Reduction

- Use the MDS method available from the Python package `scikit-learn`. Example use:
  ```python
  from sklearn.manifold import MDS

  mds = MDS(random_state=0, dissimilarity='precomputed', normalized_stress='auto')
  fit_data = mds.fit_transform(distanceMatrix)
  ```
  By default, MDS creates a 2D representation for the data, and `fit_data` will contain an array of 2D coordinates.

## Visualization: Bubble Plot

Create a bubble plot for the cities to visualize the 4D data associated with each city, including:

- 2D positions, two quantitative dimensions returned by `mds.fit_transform`.
- Population, a quantitative dimension available in the original dataframe.
- Zone information, a categorical dimension generated by the `admin_name` to zone mapping.

## Note

- Unlike Matplotlib, Plotly has a direct way to create a bubble plot using scatter. Refer to the Plotly documentation [here](https://plotly.com/python/bubble-charts/) for more details.

Feel free to explore and experiment with the data and visualization techniques. Good luck!
