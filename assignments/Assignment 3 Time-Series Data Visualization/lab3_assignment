Goal: Create a time-series visualization of  local monthly temperatures over a few years.
Data Source URL: https://data.telengana.gov.in/dataset/telengana-temperature-data-2013-2017

Data Acquisition component: You may directly download the Maximum and Minimum data sets from the source URL mentioned above or use the following steps to get the datasets as Pandas dataframes. (see https://data.telangana.gov.in/dataset/62a1cc18-7613-460b-a0b1-4b71c78fa1ce/api)
Use python api requests and query the metadata from the above mentioned URL as  
           r = requests.get("https://data.telangana.gov.in/api/1/metastore/schemas/dataset/items/62a1cc18-7613-460b-a0b1-4b71c78fa1ce&quot;)
           dataInfo = r.json()
 Use the two URLs listed in the metadata in the distributions item array of dataInfo to read_csv as
            df_max = pd.read_csv(dataInfo["distribution"][0]["downloadURL"])
            df_min = pd.read_csv(

dataInfo["distribution"][1]["downloadURL"])

Data Preparation and Data Cleaning component: Extract the data rows corresponding to Medchal district and Kapra Mandal from the data frames. 
(You may combine the two rows into a single data frame if it helps in creating the visualization.)
Use Pandas transpose (T) operation to transpose the table columns into rows and rows into columns. 
Convert the months and year data to Pandas Datetime format. (to be discussed in Day 2 of week 4 practice session).

Data Visualization component: Create line plots using either of plotly.express and seaborn to show the minimum and maximum temperatures for the months and years available in the dataset.

Sample Visuals from plotly express and seaborn are attached.

(Note: Most of the concepts used in this assignments will be covered during the week's practice session.)
